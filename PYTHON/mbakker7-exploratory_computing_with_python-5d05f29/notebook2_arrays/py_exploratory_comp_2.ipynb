We will add these three lines at the top of all upcoming notebooks as we will always be using `numpy` and `matplotlib`. "

    "### Arrays, Lists, and Tuples\n",
    "A one-dimensional array is a sequence of values that you can do math on. Next to an array, Python has several other data types that can store a sequence of values. The first one is called a `list` and is entered between square brackets. The second one is a tuple (you are right, strange name), and it is entered with parentheses. The difference is that you can change the values in a list after you create them, and you can not do that with a tuple. Other than that, for now you just need to remember that they exist, and that you *cannot* do math with either lists or tuples. When you do `2 * alist`, where `alist` is a list, you don't multiply all values in `alist` with the number 2. What happens is that you create a new list that contains `alist` twice (so it adds them back to back). The same holds for tuples. That can be very useful, but not when your intent is to multiply all values by 2. In the example below, the first value in a list is modified. Try to modify one of the values in `btuple` below and you will see that you get an error message:"

What we did is we gave the `array` function one input argument: the list `[1, 7, 2, 12]`, and the `array` function returned a one-dimensional array with those values. Lists and tuples can consist of a sequences of pretty much anything, not just numbers. In the example given below, `alist` contains 5 *things*: the integer 1, the float 20.0, the word `python`, an array with the values 1,2,3, and finally, the function `len`. The latter means that `alist[4]` is actually the function `len`. That function can be called to determine the length of an array as shown below.

Finally, plot a green dot for any point that lies in the circle with center $(x_c,y_c)=(5,0)$ and with radius $R=5$. Hint: it may be useful to compute a new array for the radial distance $r$ between any point and the center of the circle using the formula $r=\\sqrt{(x-x_c)^2+(y-y_c)^2}$.
