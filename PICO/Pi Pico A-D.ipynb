    "# Raspberry Pi Pico A/D\n",
    "You can perform the A/D conversion in polling, interrupt & FIFO with DMA mode. The ADC conversion speed per sample is 2μs that is 500kS/s. The RP2040 microcontroller operates on a 48MHZ clock frequency which comes from USB PLL. So, its ADC takes a 96 CPU clock cycle to perform one conversion. Therefore, the sampling frequency is (96 x 1 / 48MHz) = 2 μs per sample (500kS/s)."
